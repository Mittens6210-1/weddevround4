THE THIRD TASK HAS BEEN DONE IN "thirdtask" DIRECTORY AND NOT "thirdtaskcras".
KINDLY NOTE THAT "thirdtaskcras" IS A MALFUNCTIONING FILE AND THEREFORE IT WAS NOT USED.
THE CREATE REACT APP PACKAGES FAILED TO LOAD FOR THE 3RD TASK THIS IS WHY THE RAW FILES HAVE BEEN SHOWN.

1ST TASK = DONE WITH VITE

2ND TASK = DONE WITH CREATE REACT APP

3RD TASK = DONE WITH CREATE REACT APP (PACKAGES COULDN'T LOAD BUT THE CODE IS CORRECT)
